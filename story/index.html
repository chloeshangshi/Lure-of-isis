    The Lure of ISIS
Why are so many westerners drawn to the Islamic State?

The son of a Boston area police officer; a single mother of two young children; the owner of a New York convenience store and pizzeria: all three are Americans accused of attempting to aid the terrorist organization ISIS.

Since ISIS declared a worldwide caliphate in June 2014, thousands of people from around the world have flocked to Syria to join them. 

Members of the Islamic State have committed heinous crimes during their rise to power in Syria and Iraq. The group has used mass killings, torture, mutilation, and rape to maintain control of the region. They’ve set fire to their prisoners and broadcasted the beheadings of western journalists. The group claimed responsibility for the terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 130 people in November 2015 and the suicide bombing attacks in Brussels that killed 30 people in March 2016. 

Despite the abhorrent nature of these crimes, the sheer number and cross spectrum of people attracted to the cause gives pause. Westerners radicalizing online has struck fear into the public consciousness. Perhaps most frightening is the notion that a seemingly ordinary person could be convinced to leave their lives and families behind in order to travel to a foreign land to commit atrocities. 

How has ISIS used the internet as a recruitment tool? Who is joining ISIS? Why has this terrorist organization been more successful than any other in winning over the hearts and minds of so many? 

ISIS in America

In the United States, more than 250 people have either traveled to or attempted to travel to Syria in order to join ISIS, according to the FBI.

One young man who attempted the journey nearly three years ago was Nicholas Teausant, a college student and former member of the California National Guard.

The brown-haired, bespectacled Teausant first became interested in Islam after being attracted to a young Muslim woman who would only speak to Muslim men. Then 20 years old, he began researching the religion online and converted to Islam. He came to believe the Syrian government, that has committed war crimes against its own people, should be removed from power.

“I felt like I could try and help with that, and give the people freedom that they were fighting for,” he said in a jailhouse interview with a Sacramento Bee reporter.

Teausant posted online about wanting to fight in Syria and downloaded a how-to booklet for terrorist fighters from the Islamic State’s Inspire magazine. He was eventually arrested on a bus in Washington as he attempted to cross into Canada on his way to Syria. He pleaded guilty to federal terrorism at the U.S. District Court in Sacramento and faces up to 15 years in prison.

Before his arrest, authorities said he boasted to a government informant that he wanted to blow up the Los Angeles subway system and his daughter’s daycare center, which he called a “Zionist reform church.” He later denied that he’d made such statements.

“I’m tired of seeing myself portrayed as a crazy terrorist who wants to kill all Americans,” Teausant told the Sacramento Bee. “I just want to go home, back to my books and my daughter and my family.” 

But not all American ISIS sympathizers attempt the journey to Syria. Some supporters plot attacks in the U.S., provide the organization with material support, or recruit others. Alexander Ciccolo, 23, the estranged son of a Boston area cop, planned to commit mass killings at a college campus and live-stream the murders online, according to federal authorities. Noelle Velentzas, 28, the mother of two young children, planned with another woman to build a bomb in order to carry out an ISIS-inspired attack. 

In the U.S., those who support ISIS defy categorization. ISIS sympathizers differ widely in education, social class, and family background. Teenagers as young as 15 and adults as old as 47 have attempted to travel to Syria to join the group. Some are attracted by political ideologies or religion while others know little about the organization or its politics. 

Instead of analyzing demographics, those seeking to understand the lure of ISIS should study the process of radicalization, said John Horgan, a Georgia State University professor who studies psychology and terrorist behavior, 

One of those pathways appears to be a need for something more in life. A search for belonging, meaning or identity appears to be a “crucial motivator” for many Americans who embrace ISIS ideology, according to one report..

Policymakers and academics have various theories of what causes people to radicalize. Some believe political tensions or cultural rifts cause radicalization. Others believe recruits may have been drawn in by the promise of adventure. Exposure to trauma is another theory as to why some people are more susceptible to becoming extremists.

A sense of alienation, a lack of belonging, or the feeling that the powers at be aren’t doing enough to challenge the injustices in the world can push someone toward extremism, according to Erin Marie Saltman, Senior Counter Extremism Researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue in London. 

It’s usually a combination of factors that lead to radicalization and those recruited often don’t know the source of their motivation themselves, Horgan said.

“They might initially become involved because of a sense of adventure, a sense of purpose, a sense of excitement,” he said. “Somebody who becomes involved initially for reasons that are pretty low level—they’re excited by the idea and this fantasy—that might eventually morph into something a little more sophisticated. They might learn to embrace the ideology,” he said. 

Jeffrey Harp, a retired assistant special agent who spent 21 years with the FBI, described those interested in ISIS as desperate people, loners or attention seekers who are looking for a place to belong.

George Washington University researchers found that an underlying sense of sympathy and compassion appeared to play a role in initially motivating some young Americans to become interested in the Syrian conflict. Many westerners were appalled by the violence Bashar al Assad’s regime used to suppress the Syrian rebellion and the apparent inaction of the international community.

Mufid Elfgeeh, 32, who owned a pizzeria and convenience store in Rochester, N.Y., was sentenced to 22.5 years in prison for attempting to provide ISIS with “material support or resources.” He was accused of planning to kill returning U.S. soldiers and trying to recruit three people to join the terrorist organization. 

He once helped a recruit obtain a birth certificate and passport photo before his planned trip to Syria. Working through a contact in Yemen, he planned how two Rochester-area men would travel to Syria.

At his sentencing, Elfgeeh issued this statement through his lawyer:

"Like many, I was interested in the Arab Spring in Tunisia, and how it spread through Africa and the Middle East...I wanted to help my Muslim brothers fighting the horrors of the Assad regime. I was an early supporter of ISIS, as they were the first to address the crisis in Syria."

Although there are many theories exploring what causes radicalization, most experts agree that radicalization is a “highly complex and individualized process, often shaped by a poorly understood interaction of structural and personal factors,” according to a report.

ISIS and the Internet

Contrary to popular belief, the internet doesn’t have mystical powers that cause people to radicalize. An average person doesn’t just sit down in front of a computer, get sucked into ISIS propaganda, and decide to go to Syria. Usually, a human interaction in the real world ignites an interest in ISIS. But once someone starts looking for extreme information online, the internet can accelerate the radicalization process. And ISIS uses the internet and social media to spread their message and grow their ranks better than any other terrorist organization in the world ever has.

The Quilliam Foundation, a London-based think tank focused on counterterrorism, monitored the official Islamic State propaganda coming out of Syria for one month. They found that in that span of time, the group produced each day an average of about 38 unique pieces of 
propaganda—such as photo essays, videos, audio statements, news bulletins, and theological essays.

The report found ISIS to have an “exceptionally sophisticated information operation campaign” that is both high quality and produced in massive quantities.

ISIS recruitment videos are sleek and professional, visually beautiful and emotionally charged. The videos combine high quality footage and graphics with stirring music to craft a powerful cinematic effect. The fighters appear glamorous, like actors in an exciting movie. The videos are made in multiple languages, such as English, French, Russian, and German, to target audiences around the world.

Javiar Lesaca, a visiting scholar at George Washington University, analyzed 845 campaigns and found that more than 15 percent of ISIS videos were directly inspired by real films, like Saw, The Matrix, American Sniper, and V for Vendetta; or video game series such as Call of Duty, Mortal Kombat, and Grand Theft Auto. The goal of these videos: make terror popular.

ISIS is the first terrorist group to directly target audiences on a daily basis, using both the audience’s native language and their cultural language, Lesaca wrote.

“They’re probably doing this better than any other organization right now,” said Haras Rafiq, managing director of Quilliam. “This is a great case study for somebody who wants to look at how to market online.”

Experts agree that the the internet often plays a significant role in radicalization of westerners.

Online propaganda can easily illustrate and reinforce ideological messages. The web allows potential recruits to access powerful video and images that seem to substantiate extremist claims, according to a 2009 report by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College.

Those who feel lost and are searching for answers can go online--anonymously, if they so choose--and find a virtual community of people willing to provide extreme explanations. Once someone is inside these online spaces, it becomes acceptable to say things that would be considered socially unacceptable in the real world. The spaces can also serve as “echo chambers” where people are exposed to the same point of view over and over without hearing from the other side.

“We can create very quickly a self-selective vacuum of information and that’s what we see with violent extremists using the internet to really quicken up that process and drive recruitment,” Saltman said.

Thanks to the internet, ISIS sympathizers worldwide are able to share ISIS propaganda or create and share their own content in support of the organization. ISIS allows their supporters to tweet, have Facebook accounts, and put things into their own words, Saltman said.

“Really, it’s a ‘glocal’ movement, meaning it hits you on a local level with a global cause that you can attach yourself to,” she said.

However, Rafiq and Saltman both believe censorship isn’t the answer when it comes to tackling online propaganda.

Mainstream platforms work with government agencies to remove flagged content from their sites, which Saltman believes may cause ISIS supporters to migrate to less-regulated or encrypted platforms.

“And that’s dangerous because that means it’s much harder to monitor and survey and evaluate and effectively counter,” Saltman said. 

The UK government takes down about 1,100 social media accounts every week and when the accounts are removed, new accounts pop up.

“Broadly speaking, what we’re doing is playing whack-a-mole,” he said. “If it was working, we would’ve seen those numbers go down.”

Rafiq is also against censorship for philosophical reasons.

“Do we actually want to create societies whereby we’re actually controlling and censoring and monitoring thought?” he said.

While the internet does play a role in radicalization, people are rarely, if ever, radicalized in isolation of other factors.

“You don’t go online searching for shoes and accidentally become a jihadist,” Saltman said.

According to the Quilliam Foundation’s report Jihad Trending, “the vast majority of those that visit extremist websites and consume the content enthusiastically are likely to have been heading in that direction and the websites in question are merely aiding an existing journey.”

The first spark of radicalization is nearly always offline but once someone starts the journey to extremism, the internet can speed up the process, Saltman said.

“First Sparks”

According to Jihad Trending, there are four places in the United Kingdom and France that have a history of providing a gateway into radicalization: universities, prisons, mosques, and the media or news. Universities, prisons and mosques can provide a space for extremists to share their views while the media can expose people to the idea of extremism.

In prisons, there are more people who could be characterized as “identity seekers,” “protection seekers,” and “rebels” than in other environments. People often experience social isolation and personal crisis while in prison, which can increase responsiveness to extremist messages. 

“We do see that somebody might go into prison that has committed a car theft crime and come out with a violent extremist ideology,” Saltman said. 

Cherif and Said Kouachi, two French brothers who killed 12 people and injured 11 others when they attacked the Charlie Hebdo magazine headquarters in Paris on Jan. 7, 2015, were reportedly radicalized in prison. The brothers killed in the name of an Al-Qaeda branch in Yemen.

Muslims are overrepresented in prisons in the UK and France. There are 2.7 million Muslims in the UK, making up 4.8 percent of the population. However, Muslims account for up to 13.1 percent of the total prison population in the UK, according to the study. In France, the total Muslim population is estimated to be between 3 and 13 percent (the exact percentage is unknown as the French Republic prohibits performing census which make distinctions between citizens based on their race or their beliefs.) Despite the relatively low number of Muslims in France, Muslims make up a staggering 53 percent of French prisoners.

The number of people thought to have been radicalized in universities within the UK is “extensive.”  At universities, students can feel isolated and vulnerable, which can make radicalization more likely. Universities also provide spaces for people to meet and develop ideas. Research from 2005 showed that 24 different UK academic institutions contained extremist and/or terrorist organizations using campus facilities to recruit individuals and spread their messages. 

This is more of a problem in the UK than in France. Since laïcité, a strict separation of church and state passed in France in 2004, state-run bodies, such as universities, aren’t allowed to incorporate religious organizations in school as is commonly done in the UK.

Media coverage can also ignite an interest in a subject that can lead to radicalization. People see foreign fighters or terrorists on the news and seek out information through family, friends—or the internet. Once they find the right sites online, they can quickly become immersed in one-sided propaganda.

While the vast majority of mosques aren’t run by extremists, mosques are hubs where many young Muslim men can be found. Therefore, Muslims could be targeted by extremists as they are entering or leaving the mosque.

While Mosques were once a place where radical Islamists recruited followers, today it’s estimated that radicalization in mosques and other religious institutions now make up less than two percent of the total recorded radicalization cases in the UK.

In focus groups with UK-based Muslims, most participants said radicalization was not taking place inside mosques. In their attempt to remain politically neutral, some mosque leaders don’t address controversial subjects. Some participants in the study thought this was a good thing as they believed mosques should be a “pure,” space that is free of politics. However, others thought this was a disservice because it could turn younger Muslims seeking answers away from mosques and toward extremist groups, according to the study.

The Lure of ISIS: France

Kevin Guiavarch, a young sandy-haired blue-eyed man, grew up in Paris and dropped out of school after 9th grade, according to his mother Sabine Huntzinger. He dabbled in firefighter school and plumbing school but lost interest in both trades. Around that time, he converted to Islam.

At age 16, he left home with his then-girlfriend and moved to the French town Grenoble. Three years later he returned to tell his mother and her boyfriend, Samir Meddadi, that he had married a different woman and was leaving France for Syria for “humanitarian purposes.”

“He was good at hiding his intentions. I think they’re trained psychologically for that. To hide their tracks. To present yourself as someone completely different,” Meddadi said.

After Guiavarch left, his mother fell into a deep depression. She transferred money for her son from accounts from around the world some 15 times over the course of a year. Guiavarch told his mother that the funds were “gifts” to help him pay for his clothing, food, and rent. Huntzinger grew increasingly depressed and finally Meddadi told Guiavarch that Huntzinger wouldn’t transfer money any longer.

“He said, ‘You’re no longer my mother. We don’t need to talk to each other anymore,’” Meddadi said.

Meddadi sent what would be their last transfer--$500--for Guiavarch, as Huntzinger was too ill to transfer the funds herself. Shortly after, the couple was arrested and briefly jailed. The $500 Meddadi had transferred had been used to pay for a plane ticket for a young French girl who was traveling to Syria. The teenage girl, who Guiavarch had recruited, changed her mind midway through her journey and called a family member to pick her up. Officials had traced the money back to Huntzinger and Meddadi. Guiavarch hasn’t called the couple since their arrest and they are forbidden from contacting him. Their trial is pending.

More than 1,200 people have left France to join ISIS, according to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence. Some have blamed France’s lack of integration or social inequality for the high number of French nationals joining ISIS. 

As demonstrated through laïcité, France has a strict separation of church and state. While this could be seen as democratic and egalitarian, it can also be interpreted as being dismissive of certain religions, Saltman said. Those who work in civil service jobs and children attending public school cannot wear conspicuous religious symbols, such as headscarves. In 2010, the French banned face covering, including face-covering veils, and the full-body burqa, if it covers the face.

Many French Muslims are descendents of North African immigrants. Thanks to laws such as laïcité, many young Muslims may feel rejected by French society. Those who are searching for a place to belong may feel a connection with the politicized Muslim Brotherhood, which originated in North Africa, Rafiq said.

“There’s been a lot of tension for many, many years with North African and Muslim minorities within France,” Saltman said. 

But many of those who have joined ISIS, like Kevin Guiavarch, were white converts.

Another French convert, Nicolas Bons, was disappointed by western society, according to his mother, Dominique Bons. Like Guiavarch, Nicolas dropped out of school after ninth grade and had difficulty sticking to a career path.

“I felt he was a little bit lost,” Bons said. “He was shocked by what was going on around the world...he felt a little useless.”

Nicolas converted to Islam in 2009. At first, Bons thought her son was doing well with his new religion; he seemed happy and serene. He began working at a North African craftsman shop so that he would be allowed to adhere to the Muslim practice of praying five times a day. Bons remembers him arguing with her, telling her that if she didn’t come to believe in God the two of them wouldn’t meet in Heaven. He started dressing differently and stopped seeing his old friends.

“All these little things started worrying me,” she said. 

In the midst of Nicolas’ transformation, Nicolas’ younger half-brother Jean-Daniel Bons moved with his parents to France from French Guiana. Jean-Daniel, an introvert who enjoyed video games, called Nicolas to question him about his religion. Nicolas described how he’d converted. At the time, Nicolas was 27 years old and Jean-Daniel was 20.

One day, Nicolas announced that he and Jean-Daniel would be going on a trip to Thailand. Bons asked to see the tickets but Nicolas pushed back, saying a friend had their tickets. While planning their trip, “they were happy,” Bons said.

The half-brothers left for Syria while Bons was away visiting her sister. Before they left for the airport, Nicolas kissed his aunt, Bons’ sister-in-law, very hard, which she thought was strange as she thought she’d see him soon. 

“I feel horrible I wasn’t there,” Bons said. She never saw the letter that Nicolas had supposedly written to her and left in the care of a friend. 

Jean-Daniel, 23, was killed in combat near Aleppo, Syria in August 2013. Since Nicolas didn’t want to fight, he was put on a list of potential suicide bombers.

Bons remembers speaking with her son on December 19, 2013. They made plans to chat again on his birthday, December 23, but the day came and Bons was unable to reach her son. She called day after day, Christmas and New Year’s passed, and still Nicolas didn’t pick up his phone or return her calls. 

On January 12, 2014, she received a text announcing her son’s death in an explosive operation. Feeling as though she was in a nightmare, she called the number and tried to get more information, but the man on the other line only confirmed his death and said Nicolas was in paradise. 

Bons learned that her son, now 30 years old, had driven a truck outside an elementary school in the Shiite town of Umm al-Amad. The explosion killed him and at least seven other people including five children. 

In France, more than 20 percent of Muslims who joined ISIS were white converts, Rafiq said. 
Rafiq believes that motivation for radicalization isn’t racism or social problems but grievances. 

“Some experts will say that it’s poor, young, disenfranchised, uneducated individuals, usually men, that will actually go join groups like IS,” he said. “The reality is that there are people who are older, there are people who are younger, there are young girls and women, there are educated people, there are uneducated people. There’s a whole cross-spectrum of people to whom the concept of joining the Islamic State is appealing.”

More than 40 percent of people who have been convicted of Islamist terrorism in the UK had a degree or some form of higher education, Rafiq said, and more than 50 percent of the people were integrated into society, spoke English, and had access to good jobs.

Converts

Converts are particularly vulnerable to extremist ideologies, Saltman said. When someone comes to a religion late in life, he or she is looking to fully embrace it and to define to oneself how he or she can be part of the group, she said.

In the United States, converts are overrepresented among American ISIS supporters. About 40 percent of Americans arrested for ISIS-related activities are converts to Islam and an estimated 23 percent of the American Muslim population are converts, according to ISIS in America.

“The extremist group is very embracing of new recruits, is hyper-attentive to them and has a consistent narrative to them that brings them in as a full-fledged member,” Saltman said. “And that community that they give, that embracing community, can be very, very powerful.”

Saltman thinks it’s important not to dehumanize terrorists the same way terrorists dehumanize those who they justify violence against.

“An extremist starts creating a very black and white version of the world...and then they can justify violence against those they define as evil,” she said. 

“When we see the horrible things they do, we dehumanize them. We think, ‘How could they possible do it? They deserve anything they get.’ And actually, nobody is born a terrorist.”
