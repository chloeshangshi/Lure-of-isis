    <h2 class="article-header">  The Lure of ISIS</h2>
    <h4 class="article-subtitle">Why are so many westerners drawn to the Islamic State? </h4>
    


    
    <p class="article">The son of a Boston area police officer; a single mother of two young children; the owner of a New York convenience store and pizzeria: all three are Americans accused of attempting to aid the terrorist organization ISIS.</p>

<p class="article">Since ISIS declared a worldwide caliphate in June 2014, thousands of people from around the world have flocked to Syria to join them. </p>

<p class="article">Members of the Islamic State have committed heinous crimes during their rise to power in Syria and Iraq. The group has used mass killings, torture, mutilation, and rape to maintain control of the region. They’ve set fire to their prisoners and broadcasted the beheadings of western journalists. The group claimed responsibility for the terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 130 people in November 2015 and the suicide bombing attacks in Brussels that killed 30 people in March 2016. </p>

    <p class="article">Given the abhorrent nature of these crimes, the sheer number and cross spectrum of westerners attracted to the cause is baffling. The idea of westerners radicalizing online has struck fear into the public consciousness. Perhaps most disturbing is the notion that seemingly ordinary people could be convinced to leave their lives and families behind in order to travel to a foreign land to commit atrocities. </p>

    <p class="article">Who is joining ISIS—and why? What role does the internet played in radicalization? Why has this terrorist organization been more successful than any other in winning over the hearts and minds of so many? </p>

    <p class="article sub">ISIS in America</p>

    <p class="article">In the United States, more than 250 people have either traveled to or attempted travel to Syria in order to join ISIS, according to the FBI.</p>

    <p class="article">One young man who attempted the journey nearly three years ago was then 20-year-old Nicholas Teausant, a former college student and member of the California National Guard.</p>

    <p class="article">The brown-haired, bespectacled Teausant first became interested in Islam after being attracted to a young Muslim woman who would only speak to Muslim men. He began researching the religion online and converted. He came to believe the Syrian government, which has committed war crimes against its own people, should be removed from power.</p>

    <p class="article">“I felt like I could try and help with that, and give the people freedom that they were fighting for,” he said in a jailhouse interview with a Sacramento Bee reporter.</p>

    <p class="article">Teausant posted online about wanting to fight in Syria and downloaded a how-to booklet for terrorist fighters from the Islamic State’s Inspire magazine. He was eventually arrested on a bus in Washington as he attempted to cross into Canada on his way to Syria. He pleaded guilty to federal terrorism at the U.S. District Court in Sacramento and faces up to 15 years in prison.</p>

    <p class="article">Before Teausant’s arrest, authorities said he boasted to a government informant that he wanted to blow up the Los Angeles subway system and his daughter’s daycare center, which he called a “Zionist reform church.” He later denied that he’d made such statements.</p>

    <p class="article">“I’m tired of seeing myself portrayed as a crazy terrorist who wants to kill all Americans,” Teausant told the Sacramento Bee. “I just want to go home, back to my books and my daughter and my family.” </p>

    <p class="article">But not all American ISIS sympathizers are like Teausant and attempt the journey to Syria. Some supporters provide the organization with material support, or recruit others; at least 32 Americans have expressed interest in carrying out an attack on American soil. Alexander Ciccolo, 23, the estranged son of a Boston area cop, had planned to commit mass killings at a college campus and live-stream the murders online, according to federal authorities. Noelle Velentzas, 28, the mother of two young children, planned with another woman to build a bomb in order to carry out an ISIS-inspired attack last year.</p>

    <p class="article">While many imagine those joining ISIS to be young, uneducated men of middle-eastern descent or immigrants, the demographics of those accused of supporting ISIS show that this is simply not the case. Ciccolo, Velentzas, and Teausant fly in the face of this stereotype: all three were born in the United States. Ciccolo and Teausant are pale, Velentzas is female, and Teausant took college courses.</p>

    <p class="article">The trio also demonstrates the broad cross-spectrum of those drawn to ISIS. In the U.S., those who support ISIS defy categorization. ISIS sympathizers differ widely in education, social class, and family background. Those with ties to ISIS live both in big cities and rural America: those charged with having ISIS connections reside in 23 different states, including Minnesota, Florida, and Colorado. (The FBI is investigating individuals in all 50 states.) Teenagers as young as 15 and adults as old as 47 have attempted to travel to Syria. Some are attracted by political ideologies or religion while others know little about the organization or its politics. </p>

    <p class="article"><em>Instead of analyzing demographics, those seeking to understand the lure of ISIS should study the process of radicalization, says John Horgan, a Georgia State University professor who studies psychology and terrorist behavior.</em></p>

    <p class="article">Policymakers and academics have various theories of what causes people to radicalize. Some believe political tensions or cultural rifts are the root cause of radicalization. Others believe recruits may have been drawn in by the promise of adventure. Exposure to trauma is another theory as to why some people are more susceptible to becoming extremists.</p>

    <p class="article">One common mainspring of radicalization is a yearning for something more in life. A search for belonging, meaning or identity appears to be a “crucial motivator” for many Americans who embrace ISIS ideology, according to one report. A sense of alienation, a lack of belonging, or the feeling that the powers at be aren’t doing enough to challenge the injustices in the world can push someone toward extremism, according to Erin Marie Saltman, Senior Counter Extremism Researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue in London. </p>

    
    <audio controls id = "horgan2">
        <source src="../assets/videos/Attempt3Horgan_mixdown.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
    </audio>
    
    <p class="article">Most experts agree that radicalization is a complicated, individualized process. <em>Usually a combination of factors—both structural and personal—lead to radicalization and those recruited often don’t know the source of their motivation themselves, Horgan says.</em></p>

    <p class="article">“They might initially become involved because of a sense of adventure, a sense of purpose, a sense of excitement,” he says. “Somebody who becomes involved initially for reasons that are pretty low level—they’re excited by the idea and this fantasy—that might eventually morph into something a little more sophisticated. They might learn to embrace the ideology,” he says. </p>

    <p class="article"><em>Jeffrey Harp, a retired assistant special agent who spent 21 years with the FBI, described those interested in ISIS as desperate people, loners or attention seekers who are looking for a place to belong.</em></p>

    <p class="article">George Washington University researchers found that an underlying sense of sympathy and compassion appeared to play a role in initially motivating some young Americans to become interested in the Syrian conflict. Many westerners were appalled by the violence Bashar al Assad’s regime used to suppress the Syrian rebellion and the apparent inaction of the international community.</p>

    <p class="article">Sympathy for Syrians drove Mufid Elfgeeh to support ISIS. Elfgeeh, who owned a pizzeria and convenience store in Rochester, N.Y., was sentenced to 22.5 years in prison for attempting to provide ISIS with “material support or resources.” He was accused of planning to kill returning U.S. soldiers and trying to recruit three people to join the terrorist organization. </p>


    <p class="article">He helped one recruit obtain a birth certificate and passport photo before his planned trip to Syria. Working through a contact in Yemen, he planned how two Rochester-area men would travel to Syria.</p>

    <p class="article">At his sentencing, Elfgeeh issued this statement through his lawyer:</p>

    <p class="article">"Like many, I was interested in the Arab Spring in Tunisia, and how it spread through Africa and the Middle East...I wanted to help my Muslim brothers fighting the horrors of the Assad regime. I was an early supporter of ISIS, as they were the first to address the crisis in Syria."</p>

    <p class="article sub">First Sparks</p>

    <p class="article">Contrary to popular belief, the internet doesn’t have mystical powers that causes people to radicalize. An average person doesn’t just sit down in front of a computer, get sucked into ISIS propaganda, and decide to go to Syria. “You don’t go online searching for shoes and accidentally become a jihadist,” Saltman says.</p>

    <p class="article"><em>Usually, a human interaction in the real world ignites an interest in ISIS. </em>But once someone starts looking for extreme information online, the internet can accelerate the radicalization process. And ISIS uses the internet and social media to spread its message and expand its ranks better than any other terrorist organization in the world ever has.</p>

    <p class="article">There are four places in the United Kingdom and France that have a history of providing gateways to radicalization: universities, prisons, mosques, and the media. Universities, prisons and mosques can provide spaces for extremists to spread their views while news reports can expose people to the idea of extremism.</p>

    <p class="article">In prisons, there are a significant number of people with characteristics that make them vulnerable to radicalism. Many prisoners feel lost and look for an identity; others seek protection. Some prisoners see themselves as rebels or resent society. Prisoners often experience social isolation and personal crisis, which can increase their responsiveness to extreme ideas. </p>

    <p class="article">“We do see that somebody might go into prison who has committed a car theft crime and come out with a violent extremist ideology,” Saltman says. </p>

    <p class="article">For example, Cherif and Said Kouachi, two French brothers who killed 12 people and injured 11 others in the name of an Al-Qaeda branch when they attacked the Charlie Hebdo magazine headquarters in Paris on Jan. 7, 2015, were reportedly radicalized in prison.</p> 

    <p class="article">On top of that, Muslims are overrepresented in prisons in the UK and France. Some 2.7 million Muslims live in the UK, making up 4.8 percent of the population, yet they account for up to 13.1 percent of the total prison population.</p>

    <p class="article">In France, the percentage of imprisoned Muslims is even higher, possibly because police often focus their crime-prevention efforts in poor suburbs where many Muslims reside. The total Muslim population in France is estimated to be between 3–13 percent (the exact percentage is unknown as the French Republic prohibits taking census data that distinguishes between citizens based on their race or beliefs.) Despite the relatively low number of Muslims in France, Muslims make up a staggering 53 percent of French prisoners.</p>

    <p class="article">Radicalization within the university system is an extensive problem in the UK. College students often feel isolated and vulnerable, which can make radicalization more likely. Universities also provide spaces for people to meet and develop ideas. Research from 2005 showed that 24 different UK academic institutions contained extremist and/or terrorist organizations using campus facilities to recruit and spread their messages. </p>

    <p class="article">In France, radicalization at universities isn’t considered a problem. “Laïcité,” a strict separation of church and state that passed in France in 2004, prevents state-run bodies from incorporating religious organizations in school.</p>

    <p class="article">Media coverage can also ignite an interest that can lead to radicalization. People see foreign fighters or terrorists on the news and seek out information through family, friends—or the internet. Once they find the right sites online, they can quickly become immersed in one-sided propaganda.</p>

    <p class="article">Radicalization in mosques and other religious institutions make up less than two percent of radicalization cases in the UK. An introduction to extremism rarely occurs within mosques but sometimes extremists target those entering or leaving mosques.</p>

    <p class="article sub">ISIS and the Internet</p>

    <p class="article">Once someone starts on the path to radicalization, the internet can speed up the process, Saltman says. Potential recruits can access powerful images and video that reinforce ideological messages and seem to substantiate extremists claims.</p>

    <p class="article">Those who feel lost and are searching for answers can go online—anonymously, if they so choose—and find a virtual community of people willing to provide extreme explanations. Once someone is inside these online spaces, it becomes acceptable to say things that would be considered socially unacceptable in the real world. The spaces can also serve as “echo chambers” where people are exposed to the same point of view over and over without hearing from the other side.</p>

    <p class="article">“We can create very quickly a self-selective vacuum of information and that’s what we see with violent extremists using the internet to really quicken up that process and drive recruitment,” Saltman says.</p>

    <p class="article">Thanks to the internet, ISIS sympathizers worldwide are able to share ISIS propaganda or create and share their own content in support of the organization. ISIS allows their supporters to tweet, have Facebook accounts, and put things into their own words, Saltman says.</p>

    <iframe id="erin2" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/162634735?color=cbae30&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="180" height="101"  frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p class="article"><em>“Really, it’s a ‘glocal’ movement, meaning, it hits you on a local level with a global cause that you can attach yourself to,” she says.</em></p>

    <p class="article">And ISIS is particularly skilled at creating online propaganda. Researchers at the Quilliam Foundation, a London-based think tank focused on counterterrorism, monitored the official Islamic State propaganda coming out of Syria for one month. They found that during that time, the group produced each day an average of about 38 unique pieces of propaganda—such as photo essays, videos, audio statements, news bulletins, and theological essays.</p>

    <p class="article">The report found ISIS to have an “exceptionally sophisticated information operation campaign.” Their propaganda is both high quality and produced in massive quantities.</p>

    <p class="article">ISIS recruitment videos are sleek and professional, visually beautiful and emotionally charged. The videos combine high quality footage and graphics with stirring music to produce a powerful cinematic effect. The fighters appear glamorous, like actors in an exciting movie. The videos are made in multiple languages, such as English, French, Russian, and German, to target audiences around the world.</p>

    <p class="article">Javiar Lesaca, a visiting scholar at George Washington University, analyzed 845 campaigns and found that more than 15 percent of ISIS videos were directly inspired by real films, like Saw, The Matrix, American Sniper, and V for Vendetta; or video game series such as Call of Duty, Mortal Kombat, and Grand Theft Auto. The goal of these videos: make terror popular.</p>

    <p class="article">ISIS is the first terrorist group to directly target audiences on a daily basis, using both the audience’s native language and their cultural language, Lesaca wrote.</p>

    <p class="article">“They’re probably doing this better than any other organization right now,” says Haras Rafiq, managing director of Quilliam. “This is a great case study for somebody who wants to look at how to market online.”</p>

    <p class="article">Various officials, including members of the UK Parliament in 2012, have advocated censorship as a way to address online radicalization. But Rafiq and Saltman both believe censorship fails at tackling online propaganda.</p>

    <p class="article">When mainstream platforms work with government agencies to remove flagged content from their sites, ISIS supporters could easily migrate to less-regulated or encrypted platforms, Saltman says.</p>

    <p class="article">“And that’s dangerous because that means it’s much harder to monitor and survey and evaluate and effectively counter,” she says. </p>

    <p class="article">The UK government takes down about 1,100 social media accounts every week.When the accounts are removed, new accounts pop up.</p>

    <p class="article">“Broadly speaking, what we’re doing is playing whack-a-mole,” he says. “If it was working, we would’ve seen those numbers go down.”</p>

    <p class="article">Rafiq is also against censorship for philosophical reasons.</p>

    <p class="article">“Do we actually want to create societies whereby we’re actually controlling and censoring and monitoring thought?” he says.</p>

    <p class="article sub">The Lure of ISIS: France</p>

    <p class="article">All of the circumstances leading to radicalization—personal factors, institutional problems, and the internet—come into play in one country where one of the worst ISIS attacks has occurred.</p>

    <p class="article">More than 1,200 French citizens have traveled to Syria and joined ISIS. One man who made the journey is Kevin Guiavarch, a young light-skinned blue-eyed Parisian, whose parents are awaiting trial for sending him funds that were ultimately used to fund terrorist activities.</p>

    <p class="article">Guiavarch dropped out of school after 9th grade, according to his mother Sabine Huntzinger. He dabbled in firefighter school and plumbing school but lost interest in both trades. Around that time, he converted to Islam.</p>

    <p class="article">At age 16, he left home with his then-girlfriend and moved to the French town Grenoble. Three years later he returned to tell his mother and her boyfriend, Samir Meddadi, that he had married a different woman and was leaving France for Syria for “humanitarian purposes.”</p>

    <p class="article">“He was good at hiding his intentions. I think they’re trained psychologically for that. To hide their tracks. To present yourself as someone completely different,” Meddadi said.</p>

    <p class="article">After Guiavarch left, his mother fell into a deep depression. She transferred money for her son from accounts around the world some 15 times over the course of a year. Guiavarch told his mother that the funds were “gifts” to help him pay for his clothing, food, and rent. Huntzinger grew increasingly depressed and finally Meddadi told Guiavarch that Huntzinger wouldn’t transfer money any longer. Meddadi says Guiavarch emotionally abused his mother by threatening to cut off contact with her if she refused to continue connecting him to the funds.</p>

    <p class="article">Meddadi sent what would be their last money transfer—$500—as Huntzinger was too ill to send the funds herself. Shortly after, the couple was arrested and briefly jailed. The $500 Meddadi had transferred had been used to pay for a plane ticket for a young French girl who was traveling to Syria. The teenager, whom Guiavarch had recruited, changed her mind midway through her journey and called a family member to take her home. Officials traced the money back to Huntzinger and Meddadi. Guiavarch hasn’t called the couple since their arrest and the pair are forbidden from contacting him. Their trial is pending.</p>

    <p class="article">More than 1,200 people have left France to join ISIS. Some blame France’s lack of integration or social inequality for the high number of French nationals joining ISIS. </p>

    <p class="article">The country is known for its strict separation of church and state. While some see this as democratic and egalitarian, others interpret it as dismissive of certain religions, Saltman says. Those who work in civil service jobs and children attending public school cannot wear conspicuous religious symbols, such as headscarves. In 2010, the French government banned face covering, including face-covering veils. </p>

    <p class="article">Many French Muslims are descendents of North African immigrants. Thanks to laws such as laïcité, many young Muslims may feel rejected by French society. Those searching for a place to belong may feel a connection with the politicized Muslim Brotherhood, which originated in North Africa.</p>

    <p class="article">“There’s been a lot of tension for many, many years with North African and Muslim minorities within France,” Saltman says.</p> 

    <p class="article">But many of those who have joined ISIS were white converts. Two other Frenchmen who succumbed to the lure of ISIS were Nicolas Bons and his half-brother, Jean-Daniel Bons.</p>

    <p class="article">Nicolas was disappointed by western society, according to his mother, Dominique Bons. Like Guiavarch, Nicolas dropped out of school after ninth grade and had difficulty sticking to a career path. “I felt he was a little bit lost,” Bons says. “He was shocked by what was going on around the world. He felt a little useless.”</p>

    <p class="article">Nicolas, who lived with his mother in Toulouse, France, converted to Islam in 2009. At first, Bons thought her son was doing well with his new religion; he seemed happy and serene. He began working at a North African craftsman shop so that he would be allowed to adhere to the Muslim practice of praying five times a day. He argued with his mother, telling her that if she didn’t come to believe in God the two of them wouldn’t meet in Heaven. He started dressing differently and stopped seeing his old friends.</p>

    <p class="article">“All these little things started worrying me,” she says. </p>

    <p class="article">In the midst of Nicolas’ transformation, Nicolas’ younger half-brother Jean-Daniel Bons moved to France. Jean-Daniel, an introvert who enjoyed video games, called Nicolas to question him about his religion. Nicolas described how he’d converted. At the time, Nicolas was 27 years old and Jean-Daniel was 20.</p>

    <p class="article">One day, Nicolas announced that he and Jean-Daniel would be going on a trip to Thailand. Bons asked to see the tickets but Nicolas pushed back, saying a friend had them. While planning their trip, “they were happy,” Bons says.</p>

    <p class="article">The half-brothers departed for their trip while Bons was away visiting her sister. Before they left for the airport, Nicolas kissed his aunt, Bons’ sister-in-law, very hard, which she thought was odd, since she thought she’d see him soon. It was only later, when the family learned the two men had gone to Syria rather than Thailand, that the gesture made sense: Nicolas likely knew he would never see his family again.</p>

    <p class="article">“I feel horrible I wasn’t there,” Bons says. She never saw the letter that Nicolas insisted he had written to her and left in the care of a friend. </p>

    <p class="article">Jean-Daniel, 23, was killed in combat near Aleppo, Syria in August 2013. Since Nicolas didn’t want to fight, he was put on a list of potential suicide bombers.</p>

    <p class="article">Bons spoke with her son on December 19, 2013. They made plans to chat again on his birthday, December 23, but the day came and Bons was unable to reach her son. She called day after day, Christmas and New Year’s passed, and still Nicolas didn’t pick up his phone or return her calls. </p>

    <p class="article">On January 12, 2014, she received a text announcing her son’s death in an explosion. Feeling as though she was in a nightmare, she called the number and tried to get more information, but the man on the other line only confirmed her son’s death and said Nicolas was in paradise. </p>

    <p class="article">Bons learned that her son, then 30 years old, had driven a truck outside an elementary school in the Shiite town of Umm al-Amad. An explosion killed him and at least seven other people, including five children. </p>

    <p class="article">In France, more than 20 percent of Muslims who joined ISIS were white converts, Rafiq says. Rafiq believes that motivation for radicalization isn’t racism or social problems but rather, grievances. </p>

    <p class="article">“Some experts will say that it’s poor, young, disenfranchised, uneducated individuals — usually men — that will actually go join groups like IS,” he says. “The reality is that there are people who are older, there are people who are younger, there are young girls and women, there are educated people, there are uneducated people. There’s a whole cross-spectrum of people to whom the concept of joining the Islamic State is appealing.”</p>

    <p class="article">More than 40 percent of people who have been convicted of Islamist terrorism in the UK had a degree or some form of higher education, Rafiq says, and more than 50 percent of the people were integrated into society, spoke English, and had access to good jobs.</p>
    
    <iframe id="erin3" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/162634751?color=f0d000&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="180"  frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p class="article">Converts are particularly vulnerable to extremist ideologies, Saltman says. When someone comes to a religion late in life, he or she is looking to fully embrace it and to define to oneself how he or she can be part of the group, she says.</p>

    <p class="article">In the United States, converts are overrepresented among American ISIS supporters. About 40 percent of Americans arrested for ISIS-related activities are converts to Islam and an estimated 23 percent of the American Muslim population are converts.</p>

    <p class="article">“The extremist group is very embracing of new recruits, is hyper-attentive to them and has a consistent narrative to them that brings them in as a full-fledged member,” Saltman says. “And that community that they give, that embracing community, can be very, very powerful.”</p>

    <p class="article">Saltman thinks it’s important not to dehumanize terrorists the same way terrorists dehumanize those who they justify violence against.</p>

    <p class="article">“An extremist starts creating a very black and white version of the world,” she says. “And then they can justify violence against those they define as evil….When we see the horrible things they do, we dehumanize them,” she says. “We think, ‘How could they possible do it? They deserve anything they get.’ And actually, nobody is born a terrorist.”</p>
